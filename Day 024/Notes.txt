Class on "Git Pull", which is a combination of "Git Fetch" and "Git Merge".

The git pull command is essential in collaborative development with Git and platforms like GitHub. It updates your local repository with the latest changes from the remote repository by combining two actions: git fetch (downloads the updates) and git merge (merges them into your local branch).

Key Functions:
Update Local Repository: Ensures you are working with the latest version of the code.
Prevent Code Conflicts: Helps avoid overwriting or conflicting with teammates' changes by bringing the newest updates to your local environment.
Sync Branches: Keeps branches in sync with the remote repository, essential for continuous integration.
Importance:
Helps teams collaborate more efficiently by ensuring that everyone works with the most up-to-date version of the code.
Reduces potential code conflicts and maintains a clear commit history for better version control.
